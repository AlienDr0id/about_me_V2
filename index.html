  <P>
    I am a Mechanical Engineer who is passionate about engineering and science. For
    as long as I can remember I have had a very curious and experimental nature.
    Creating, breaking down, and understanding things has always been my hobby. I
    believe being an engineer is not just a career, it means being creative, being a
    volunteer, and providing sustainable solutions to daily problems.
